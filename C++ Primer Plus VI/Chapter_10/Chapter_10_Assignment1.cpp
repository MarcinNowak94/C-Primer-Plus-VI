/*
1. Provide method definitions for the class described in Chapter Review Question 5
and write a short program that illustrates all the features.

Question:
5. Define a class to represent a bank account.Data members should include the
depositor’s name,the account number (use a string),and the balance.Member functions 
should allow the following: 
-Creating an object and initializing it. 
-Displaying the depositor’s name,account number,and balance 
-Depositing an amount of money given by an argument 
-Withdrawing an amount of money given by an argument 

Just show the class declaration,not the method implementations.
(Programming Exercise 1 provides you with an opportunity to write the implementation.)
