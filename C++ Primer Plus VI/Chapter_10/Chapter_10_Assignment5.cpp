/*
5. Consider the following structure declaration:
struct customer
{
char fullname[35];
double payment;
};
Write a program that adds and removes customer structures from a stack,represented by
a Stack class declaration.Each time a customer is removed,his or her payment
should be added to a running total,and the running total should be reported.
Note:You should be able to use the Stack class unaltered;just change
the typedef declaration so that Item is type customer instead of unsigned long.
